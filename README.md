# Hand Emoji Recognition System
Developed a hand gestures recognition system for mapping symbolic hand gestures to analogous hand emoji in computer-mediated communication
using CNN architecture in machine learning.
Proposed a user-defined hand gesture set that is highly representative of several visual communication markers that can identify hand gestures with
an accuracy of 98%.
Used CNN architecture coded in python using TensorFlow machine learning API.
